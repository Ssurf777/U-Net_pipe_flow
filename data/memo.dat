File Name: cfd_data.npy
Shape: (N, 7)
Description: This file contains CFD simulation data extracted from a 3D mesh. Each row represents one spatial point within the computational domain.

Column Definitions:

Index	Column	Description
0	x	X-coordinate of the point
1	y	Y-coordinate of the point
2	z	Z-coordinate of the point
3	u	Velocity component in X-direction
4	v	Velocity component in Y-direction
5	w	Velocity component in Z-direction
6	p	Pressure at the point

Note:
All physical quantities are stored as floating point numbers (typically float32 or float64, depending on the source data).
Units depend on the original simulation and are not included in this file.
